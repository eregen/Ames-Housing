# Ames Housing Data and Kaggle Challenge

Welcome to Project 2! It's time to start modeling.

You are tasked with creating a regression model based on the Ames Housing Dataset. This model will predict the price of a house at sale.

The Ames Housing Dataset is an exceptionally detailed and robust dataset with over 70 columns of different features relating to houses.
